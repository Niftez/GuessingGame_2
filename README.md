# GuessingGame

This is a simple guessing game, where the user will guess a number between 1 and 10.

It demonstrate while loops using i (renamed guess_count) as the user gets three
tries in oirder to guess the number. It also shows how using a break will allow the program
to transition into a stop/ else statement rather than it being an awkward ending.
